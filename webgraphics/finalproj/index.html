    <h3> Park Map </h3>
    <p> The idea here was to recreate the Griffith Park map to be more simpler for people who have never been. I kept all the relevant symbols and even added a museum icon for recreational things, since they were not marked before. </p>

    <img src="images/campground-icons.png" alt="Campground Icons">
    <h3> Campground Icons </h3>
    <p> These were redesigns of previous icons for a campground. These ones are more simpler, with the picnic area being represented by a picnic basket. The picnic table is normally used to represent this, but a picnic basket is much easier to recognize. </p>

<div class="col">
    <img src="images/barkforthemasquerade.png" alt="barking for masquerade poster">
    <h3> Barking for the Masquerade Poster </h3>
    <p> This was for the local animal shelter, who were holding a fundraiser. I incorporated an animal-like face onto a masquerade mask to tie in both the theme and the fact that it is hosted by the animal shelter. </p>

    <img src="images/sports-icons.png" alt="Sports Icons">
    <h3> Sports Icons </h3>
    <p> As with the campground icons, these are also made to be simpler and easy to recognize. I added in a light colored, paleish background so that it wouldn't be too jarring, since the thick lines in the drawings are already easy to see from a distance. </p>
